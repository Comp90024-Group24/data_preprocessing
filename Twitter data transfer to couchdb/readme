# CouchDB Data Import Script

This script is used to import JSON formatted data into a CouchDB database.

## Dependencies

- couchdb: Used for connecting to and manipulating CouchDB databases.
- ijson: Used for iterative JSON parsing to read data from the JSON file.
- decimal: Used for handling floating-point number data types.

## Instructions

1. Install the dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install couchdb ijson
   ```

2. Modify the connection parameters:

   - Update the `username` and `password` variables with your CouchDB instance's username and password.
   - Modify `172.26.134.204:5984` to match the address and port number of your CouchDB instance.

3. Specify the database name:

   - Modify the `db_name` variable to the desired database name where you want to import the data.

4. Prepare the data file:

   - Place the JSON data file you want to import in a suitable location and update the file path in the `open()` function with the appropriate file path parameter.

5. Run the script:

   - Execute the script in the command line:

     ```shell
     python data_import_script.py
     ```

   - The script will read the data file line by line and import the data into the specified CouchDB database.
   - During the import process, the script will convert floating-point number fields to their respective data types and perform batch save operations based on the specified batch size.
   - The import progress will be displayed in real-time on the console.

6. Import completed:

   - Once the import is finished, you can view the imported data in the specified CouchDB database.
